## Getting Started

At a minimum you will need CMake and a C++ compiler that supports C++17. CMake will test for other prerequisites.

## Building

Change directories to the parallel folder and if it is your first time opening, type cmake3 to compile the make files.

```
cmake3 .
```

See the details in the parallel folder for details about the code.
